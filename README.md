### Features<a name="features"/>

* Basic support for the GEDCOM child linkage status field (currently editable only via raw GEDCOM, this is a FAMC attribute which allows to mark family - child relations as challenged, proven or disproven):

* Translations may be contributed via weblate: <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/vesta-webtrees-custom-modules/>

### Installation<a name="installation"/>

* Unzip the files and copy the contents of the modules_v4 folder to the respective folder of your webtrees installation. All related modules are included in the zip file. It's safe to overwrite the respective directories if they already exist (they are bundled with other custom modules as well), as long as other custom models using these dependencies are also upgraded to their respective latest versions.
* Enable the extended 'Families' module via Control Panel -> Modules -> All modules -> ⚶ Vesta Families.
* Configure the visibility of the old and the extended 'Families' tab via Control Panel -> Modules -> Tabs (usually, you'll want to use only one of them. You may just disable the original 'Families' module altogether).
